				<h3>Whistle Punks, Vauxhall</h3>
				<p>It's nice to do something different once in a while, and competitive axe throwing seems to be it. The concept is simple: you throw axes. You get placed into one of two teams and then go on to compete against each other in a tournament hurling hatchets at a wooden target at the end of the range. Don't worry, you will be taught exactly how to throw that axe before you wound yourself or others. Backed with great music and the chance to socialise between throws, this is one of the most satisfying social day or night out you'll have.<br /><br />

	        	<h2>Basquiat: Boom For Real</h2>
				<p><div class="info">Barbican Art Gallery<br />
				Until Jan 28<br /><br /></div>
				Jean-Michel Basquiat was one of the most significant painters of the 20th century, coming of age in the late 70s in the post-punk underground art scene in downtown New York. The exhibition brings together an outstanding selection of more than 100 works! More than any other exhibition to date, there is a focus on the artist’s relationship to music, writing, performance, film and television, placing him within the wider cultural context of the time. Paintings, drawings, notebooks and objects are presented alongside rare film, photography, music and archival material.<br /><br />

	        	<h2>Rachel Whiteread</h2>
				<p><div class="info">Tate Britain<br />
				Until Jan 21<br /><br /></div>
				Whiteread was the first woman to win the Turner Prize in 1993 and this exhibition brings together over 25 years of this leading contemporary artist’s sculpture. She uses industrial materials including plaster, concrete, resin, rubber and metal to cast everyday objects and architectural space. Casting sinks, baths, mattresses, staircases and book corridors among many other things, her sculptures are both deadpan and affecting. The works are a true exploration of ‘negative space’ where volumes of air are rendered solid.<br /><br />

				<p><div class="info">The Store X The Vinyl Factory, 180 Strand<br />
				Until Dec 10<br /><br /></div>
				Arthur Jafa’s 2016 meticulously edited 7-minute film probes the relationship between mainstream media and African-American identity.

Alongside this, there’s the <i>Everything At Once</i> exhibition featuring 45 interconnected multisensory works encompassing installation, painting, sculpture, performance and sound.<br /><br />

				<p><div class="info">Somerset House<br />
				Until Feb 4<br /><br /></div>
				Featuring contemporary photography, fashion and multimedia work, this exhibition highlights how the realities of life in the north of England captured in the mid-20th century continue to influence new generations of photographers, artists and designers. It features over 100 photographs, fashion garments and artworks from renowned photographers, designers and artists. The show looks at the themes and tropes present, and considers why these representations are increasingly a source of inspiration and still so idealised today.<br /><br />

				<p><div class="info">Kew Gardens<br />
				Until March 11<br /><br /></div>
				Inspired by the ancient Egyptian preserved funeral garlands in the Kew Gardens collection, Rebecca has strung 1,000 of her own individually sewn garlands using flowers she’s dried and preserved over a 6 year period for this installation.

	        	<h2>Scythians: Warriors Of Ancient Siberia</h2>
				<p><div class="info">British Museum<br />
				Until Jan 14<br /><br /></div>
				The Scythians were formidable warriors, nomadic tribes and masters of mounted warfare between 900 and 200 BC. Their encounters with the Greeks, Assyrians and Persians were contained in history but for centuries their culture was lost, buried beneath the ice. Scythian objects have been discovered, revealing a rich civilisation of terrifying, tattooed warriors from territories that stretched from Central Asia to Eastern Europe. Parallels have even been made between the Scythians and the Dothraki of Game of Thrones.<br /><br />
